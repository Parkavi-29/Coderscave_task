# CALCULATOR #Normal task 
#The objective of this project is to design and develop a calculator application in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application should provide a user-friendly interface and accurate calculations.
num1 = int(input('Enter the  number1:')) # Enter the value of num1
num2 = int(input('Enter the  number2:')) # Enter the value of num1
user = input('Enter any one of the operation(+,-,*,/,//): ') #selecting any one of the option to perform calculation
if user == '+':
    print(num1 + num2)
elif user == '-':
    print(num1 - num2)
elif user == '/':
    if num2 != 0:
        print(num1 / num2)
    elif num2 == 0:
        print("undefined")
    else:
        print('0')
elif user == '*':
    print(num1*num2)
elif user == '//':
    print(num1 // num2)
else:
    print('0')
# if user enters any one of the option that is not mentioned
