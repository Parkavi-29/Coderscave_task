#Golden task #RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR
#The objective of this project is to design and develop a random password generator application that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords with various criteria. The application should provide options for password length, character types, and special requirements.
import random
numbers = '1234567890'
special_character = "!@#$%^&*()_."
lowercase = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
uppercase = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
string = lowercase + uppercase + numbers + special_character #converting it as string for generating  the password
length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))#deciding the length of the password
new_password = ''.join(random.sample(string,length))
print('The new auto generated password: ' + new_password)
